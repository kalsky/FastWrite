A T9-keyboard for your Windows [not maintained]

An old project that was made using VB6, back in the days when Nokia ruled the cellphone market.
They allowed to type messages using the 9/10 keys that were available for the user.

This application was trying to get this same approach to Windows, and allowing to use just the keypad as a way to quickly type.

Since it's not only 9 keys, but also has a words database, it suggested the word based on the popularity to quickly complete the typed word.

The database is built into an MS Access file.

This is now publicly available and not supported, just as a reference to how keyboard hooks were used, etc.

I learned a lot during this project, including marketing, billing and support - which was all very fun to learn and do.

While it started as a quick typing tool for any end user, it was very interesting and encouraging to learn that many people with disabilities found it as a great tool that really helped them in their daily lives.
