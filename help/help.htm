      <p>After installation FastWrite is ready to go.<br>
      All you have to do is sit down, stretch your HAND and start writing fast. </p>
      <p>The default type mode after installation is SingleTap. In this mode you have to press once on each key to build your word (hello = 49556 ). </p>
      <p>After you tap the word, if FastWrite didn't give you the right word, you can flip forward and backward through the matching words using the NEXT '*' and PREV '/' keys accordingly. </p>
      <p>To change modes you can use the 'Num Lock' key or left click on the tray icon. </p>
      <p>If you want a capital letters in your words you have to do the following: </p>
      <p>After you write your word, press the '+' key, it will make the first letter uppercased. Press the '+' key again and it will make the whole word uppercased, press it for the third time and the whole word will return to lowercase. </p>
      <p>Enjoy your FastWrite. </p>
      <p><img src="images/dot.gif" width="300" height="2"><br>
        <span class="style11"><a name="types"></a>Type Modes </span></p>
      <p><strong>MultiTap <br>
      </strong>Tapping on one key will cycle through that key letters.<br>
      Use this mode if you cannot find your word in FastWrite dictionary (using the '*' key to go though the matching words in SingleTap or SingleTap+ modes ).<br>
      When you tap on a key, it will show you the first letter of that key (for instance 'g' when you press on '4'). Tap again on the same key and the letter will change to the second letter, and so on... Once you found the desired key, wait for the caret to move right (or move with the arrow keys by yourself), and tap the next letter. </p>
      <p><strong>SingleTap <br>
      </strong>In this mode you have to press once on each key to build your word.<br>
      All you have to do when you want to write a word is to tap once on each key that has the current letter on the word.<br>
      For example if you want to write 'hello', just tap '49556'.<br>
      If FastWrite didn't give you the word that you meant, cycle through the matching words using the NEXT key '*' and PREV key '/'. To accept the word and move on, press the SPACE '0' key. </p>
      <p><strong>SingleTap </strong><strong>+<br>
      </strong>Like SingleTap but in this mode FastWrite will complete the word for you .<br>
      While you type the first letters of a word, FastWrite will show you the most commonly word that start with these letters.<br>
      For example , if you try to write 'possible', after 3 letters FastWrite will give you this word, when the 'pos' part is written and the 'sible' part is selected, like this: pos<span class="style13">sible</span><br>
      If FastWrite found the word that you've meant, just press on the SPACE '0' key to accept the word, otherwise, keep tapping on the next letters of your word, or use the NEXT '*' and PREV '/' keys to find another possible match.<br>
      If FastWrite gave you a word that contains your word ('portable' when you wanted to write 'port'), you can use the NEXT and PREV keys to find your word, or you can use the BACK '-' key do delete the selected part, and then use the SPACE key to accept the word. </p>
      <p><strong>Numbers <br>
      </strong>In this mode the Numpad is used as if FastWrite doesn't work, and the Num Lock is ON. </p>
      <p><strong>Off <br>
      </strong>In this mode the Numpad is used as if FastWrite doesn't work, and the Num Lock is OFF. </p>
      <p><a href="#Top" class="style3">Back to Top</a>  </p>
      <p><span class="style11"><img src="images/dot.gif" width="300" height="2"><br>
          <a name="special"></a>Special Keys </span></p>
      <p><strong>Num Lock<br>
      </strong>Cycles through MultiTap/SingleTap/SingleTap+/Numbers/Off type modes. </p>
      <p><strong>Next ‘*' and Prev ‘/'<br>
      </strong>Cycles through the possible words, according to the letters that were tapped.<br>
      In MultiTap, cycling is done on the last key that was tapped.<br>
      In SingleTap, cycling is done on the possible words that match the keys that were tapped.<br>
      In SingleTap+, cycling is done on the possible words that match the keys that were tapped and on available words that starts with the matching keys that were tapped.<br>
      In Numbers and Off modes, these keys have the default usage (‘*' and ‘/'). </p>
      <p><strong>Back ‘-‘<br>
      </strong>This key has the function of the Back Space.<br>
      Use it to delete words/letters if you had mistakes.<br>
      That way if you delete only part of the word, you can continue typing and FastWrite will find the word for you.<br>
      <em>Note: in SingleTap+ mode you can use the ‘-‘ key to delete the completion that FastWrite suggested. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Capital Letters ‘+'<br>
      </strong>In MultiTap, after you found the desired letter, you can use the ‘+' key to make it uppercased or lowercased.<br>
      In SingleTap and SingleTap+, after you write your word, press the '+' key, it will make the first letter uppercased. Press the '+' key again and it will make the whole word uppercased, press it for the third time and the whole word will return to lowercase. </p>
      <p><strong>Space ‘0' / Enter<br>
      </strong>In SingleTap and SingleTap+, the ‘0' key has the function of the Space Bar.<br>
      Once you typed your word and you want to move on to the next word, use the ‘0' to approve the word you've just typed (the Enter key will approve the word and get down a line).<br>
      <em>Note: in SingleTap+ you can use the ‘0' key if FastWrite completed the word for you and you want to move on to the next word. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Add ‘.'<br>
      </strong>If you find a word that is not in the FastWrite dictionary and you want to add it for future use, you may use the ‘.' Key.<br>
      First you will have to type the word (either in MultiTap or SingleTap+MultiTap or using the standard keyboard) and than while the caret is at the end of the word, press the ‘.' Key.<br>
      <em>Note: an easier way to add words is through the settings option ‘Teach FastWrite your words'. </em></p>
      <p><strong>Sym '7'<br>
      </strong>If you need to type a symbol character, use the '7' key, and cycle through all the options using the Next and Prev keys.</p>
      <p><a href="#Top" class="style3">Back to Top</a></p>
      <p><img src="images/dot.gif" width="300" height="2"><br>
        <span class="style11"><a name="settings"></a>Settings </span></p>
      <p><strong>Startup<br>
      </strong>
        <span class="style14">Start with Windows</span> - Starts FastWrite on windows startup.<br>
      <span class="style14">Check for updates on Startup</span> - Each time FastWrite is started, it checks for updates availability.<br>
      <span class="style14">Start Minimized</span> - Opens FastWrite minimized.</p>            
      <p><strong>Default Type Mode<br>
      </strong>Choose the type mode that will be active each time on the start-up of FastWrite, or choose to save the last used mode. </p>
      
      <p><strong>Functionality<br>
      </strong>
        <span class="style14">Fast Delete</span> - If not selected, FastWrite will try to connect to words while you delete so that you may continue to write from a middle of a word. If you select this option, FastWrite will only know how to deal with the current word, and will delete previous words without connecting to them...<br>
      <span class="style14">Auto add new words</span> - While you type, after each Space hit, the words you just entered will be added to the dictionary if it is not exist.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Words Priority Database<br>
      </strong>The words priority database is the list of words that FastWrite knows and their priorities by which you get the words as you type (using SingleTap and SingleTap+). While you type the priority of the words is changing according to your selections and adapting the database to your use.<br>
      With the following settings you can change the priorities database:<br>
      <span class="style14">Set to default</span> – sets the priorities to their default state (like after installation)<br>
      <span class="style14">Teach FastWrite your words</span> – allows you to give FastWrite some text that contains your mostly used words. You may give some text from your daily emails, documents, chats, source code, etc. <br>
      The more words you give, the more accurate FastWrite will be for you. </p>
      <p><strong>Main Window Transparency<br>
      </strong>Move the slide bar to set the level of transparency for the main FastWrite window. </p>
